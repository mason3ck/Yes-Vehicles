[V: 2.1]
A true implementation of vehicles into RimWorld!

First off, a big thank you to Jecrell, without him none of you would have this!

This mod is a 'simple' implementation of a truck into our lovely rim world, you can load crew, passengers, turrets, and equipment for both crossing the map and for caravanning.

To acquire a vehicle you need to research Machining and Smithing for the Vehicle Table. Here you can construct a box filled with appropriately named pieces.
After following guides 1-Z on your ikea manual and throwing away the last 5 screws your pawn will have succesfully assembled a working scrap heap!

Just like any partially oiled machine, youll have to fill and power it with Chemfuel! (not included)

Upon assigning a driver, you must instruct the vehicle to draft itself for glorious duty.

==Notes and Help==

-If your goal is caravanning, please make sure to undraft the vehicle, if that doesnt work, force it onto the edge of the map then undraft
-Save Load Safe (but once you go vehicular, you cant turn back >:D )
-No one else should show up on your door with any of this stuff
-You need both a gunner and a driver to fight.
-Only the infantry turret fits on the Truck.
-Bugs will be plenty in this mod, but hopefully that'll to break your game!
